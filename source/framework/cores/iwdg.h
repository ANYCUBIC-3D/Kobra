 * @brief Independent watchdog support.
 *
 * To use the independent watchdog, first call iwdg_init() with the
 * appropriate prescaler and IWDG counter reload values for your
 * application.  Afterwards, you must periodically call iwdg_feed()
 * before the IWDG counter reaches 0 to reset the counter to its
 * reload value.  If you do not, the chip will reset.
 *
 * Once started, the independent watchdog cannot be turned off.
