// Define constants and variables for buffering incoming serial data.  We're
// using a ring buffer (I think), in which head is the index of the location
// to which to write the next incoming character and tail is the index of the
// location from which to read.
// NOTE: a "power of 2" buffer size is reccomended to dramatically
//       optimize all the modulo operations for ring buffers.
// WARNING: When buffer sizes are increased to > 256, the buffer index
// variables are automatically increased in size, but the extra
// atomicity guards needed for that are not implemented. This will
// often work, but occasionally a race condition can occur that makes
// Serial behave erratically. See https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/2405
